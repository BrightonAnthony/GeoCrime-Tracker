<h1>GeoCrime-Tracker</h1>

The project aims to provide an integrated crime mapping and prediction system using GIS (Geographic Information System) technology.
The system will allow police and the public to enter crime data, generate real-time alerts, identify crime hotspots, predict potential crime hotspots, and visualize criminal profiles area-wise. 
The four main modules of the system are:

<h4>Crime Hotspot Analysis:</h4> 
The proposed system leverages GIS technology to provide detailed, area-specific crime mapping, enabling users to view crime trends geographically.
The system uses both the approved current data and past crime data to generate hotspots in specific areas.

<h4>Real-Time Crime Monitoring:</h4>
Users (public) enter crime-related information via a web portal.
Data goes through an approval process by the police.
The system generate real-time crime alerts.

<h4>Crime Hotspot Prediction:</h4>
Based on the data collected, the system will predict crime hotspots using historical data analysis and machine learning techniques.

<h4>Criminal Profile Visualization:</h4>
A comprehensive criminal profile system that records the criminal’s history of offenses.
Visual representation of the criminal’s activities on the map, showing the areas where crimes were committed.
